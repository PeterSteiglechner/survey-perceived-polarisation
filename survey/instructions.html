            In this study, we will first ask a few questions about your own political beliefs. There are no right or
            wrong answers. In the next chapter, you will list a few social contacts. We then ask you to report what you
            think these social contacts would answer to the political questions. Finally, we ask you to map your own and
            your social contacts political positions on a 2D map. We will provide some political statements and ask you
            to also position these statements into the map.
