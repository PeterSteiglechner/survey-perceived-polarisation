            Instructions
        </h3>

 <p> In this survey, we first ask a few questions about your political views. Next, we ask you to name 3 people you know and estimate how they would respond to the same questions. You will also estimate how a typical Green voter and a typical AfD voter would respond. In the main part of the survey, we ask you to place these opinions—including your own—on a political map. </p> <div class="instructions" style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; border-radius: 4px;"> <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;"> There are no right or wrong answers. Responses are anonymous and used solely for academic research. </p> </div>
 
 <p><i>You will be paid XX if you complete all steps.</i></p>
