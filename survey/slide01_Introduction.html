            Instructions
        </h3>

 <p> In this survey, you will first answer a few questions about your political views. Next, you will name three people you know and estimate how they would respond to the same questions. You will also estimate the views of a typical Green and AfD voter. Then, you will place all these opinions—including your own—on a political map. Finally, you'll position a few additional example statements on this map. </p> <div class="instructions" style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; border-radius: 4px;"> <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;"> There are no right or wrong answers. Responses are anonymous and used solely for academic research. </p> </div>
 
 <p><i>You will be paid XX if you complete all steps.</i></p>
